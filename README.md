# TIL

Inspired by the great repository https://github.com/jbranchaud/til I started my own
TIL repository.

A list of small interesting things that I learned and I want to share.

## Ruby

- [Create a single-file executable with dependencies](ruby/create-a-single-file-executable-with-dependencies.md)

## Unix

- [Replace text in multiple files](unix/replace-text-in-multiple-files.md)

##Â VIM

- [Avoid nested editors in neovim with nvr](avoid-nested-editors-in-neovim-with-nvr.md)
- [Command line window](command-line-window.md)
